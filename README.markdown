Partycat Sunrise Alarm Clock
============================

This is the firmware for my alarm clock based on a lightbox full of WS2812 RGB
LEDs which animates a sunrise when it's time to wake up.

It uses my [partycat LED controller PCB](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/2mZvQlLz)
providing a wifi-equipped ESP8266 microcontroller.
